  <News title='Diversity and inclusion' date='July 5'>
    <p>The CampJS team would like to acknowledge and apologise for failing on diversity and inclusivity at the upcoming CampJS in Melbourne. </p>

    <p>We have not met the expectations of the community or of ourselves in this matter.</p>

    <p>There are no excuses. We need to get better at this.</p>

    <p>CampJS aims to be a welcoming and safe environment for all members of the JavaScript community to come together. We are grateful to have have received a lot of advice and feedback and are currently working our way through it and putting together action items to be addressed. We are making a commitment to work together as a community to make things better for this camp and for future camps as well.</p>

    <p>Based on this feedback, the first thing we are doing is making more information on key issues, processes, and current status publicly available on our website.</p>

    <p>If you are interested in following or contributing to this process discussion is (currently) happening on github <a href='https://github.com/campjs/campjs-next/issues/52'>here</a>.</p>

    <p>Thank you,</p>

    <p>The CampJS team.</p>
