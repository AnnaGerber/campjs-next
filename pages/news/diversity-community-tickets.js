    <Text>
      The CampJS Diversity and Community Ticket program is positioned to make sure that we reach as many Campers from as many parts of the JavaScript Community as we possibly can.

      If you're from an under-represented part of our community, then you're welcome to apply for a Diversity Ticket so we can work on some balance.

      If you're just not able to make a ticket a reality, then we'd love to have you apply for a Community Ticket.

      We can't help you get to Melbourne, but we've got your back from the Camp side of things!

      Oh, and if you know someone who fits either of those criteria, let them know we'd love to hear from them. â›º
